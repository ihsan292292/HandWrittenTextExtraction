# HandWrittenTextExtraction
### TCS iON RIO125 â€“ Automate extraction of handwritten text from an image

The project was done under TCS iON as a virtual internship and aims to extract handwritten text from images using Deep Learning. Trained a Tensorflow Keras model on IAM public  dataset on a sample of 90000 images using a CRNN architecture with a CTC loss function. Achieved a testing levenshtein accuracy of 92-94% and was deployed using streamlit cloud
